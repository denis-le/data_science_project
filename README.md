# Students' Performance Project
## Introduction
The objective of this project is to practice using Python and its libraries in order to analyze a dataset. In particular, the questions I want to answer from this dataset on students' performance index were:
- Is there a correlation between the performance of a student and their previous test scores?
- What are the three top factors in a student's academic performance?
- How does sleep affect a student's performance?

After answering those, the next step would be to use a regression model to predict a student's performance based on the top factors. To assist me, I referenced [this article](https://365datascience.com/tutorials/python-tutorials/predictive-model-python/) to determine the top factors that affect a student's performance, and a guide on [multiple regression](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ml_multiple_regression.asp) for my predictive model.
